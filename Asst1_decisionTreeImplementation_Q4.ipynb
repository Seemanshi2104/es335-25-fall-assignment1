    "The overall approach of this code is to analyze the runtime complexity of decision trees experimentally. It does this by generating synthetic datasets of different sizes (varying number of samples N and features M), training and testing a decision tree multiple times to get average training and prediction times, and then plotting how these times scale with N and M. This process is repeated for all four types of decision trees (real/discrete inputs × real/discrete outputs), and the results are saved as plots to compare the empirical runtime with theoretical complexity. In this question, we plotted runtime against N while keeping M=5, and against M while keeping N= 20. \n",
